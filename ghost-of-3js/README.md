## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Requirements**
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- HTTP server (for loading modules and assets)

### **Running the Game**

1. **Clone/Download** the game files to your local machine
2. **Start a local server** in the game directory:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8080
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server -p 8080
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8080
   ```
3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
4. **Click anywhere** to lock the mouse pointer and start playing
5. **Press T** for the in-game tutorial

### **Performance Tips**
- The game uses toon shading and reduced pixel ratio for artistic effect
- Adjust your browser's hardware acceleration settings if needed
- Close other tabs/applications for better performance
- The world generates dynamically - expect brief loading when exploring new areas

## üé® Visual Style

The game uses a unique **pixel toon shader** approach that combines:
- **Flat shading** for geometric surfaces
- **Quantized lighting** for toon effect
- **Rim lighting** for character definition
- **Atmospheric fog** for depth and mood
- **Dynamic sky** with time-of-day effects
- **Wind particle systems** for environmental storytelling

## üîä Audio Design

All audio is **procedurally generated** using the Web Audio API:
- **Wind Ambience**: Continuous atmospheric wind sounds
- **Nature Sounds**: Randomly triggered birds, rustling leaves, bamboo creaks
- **UI Feedback**: Tones and chords for interface interactions
- **Spatial Audio**: Volume and effects change based on player position

## üåç World Design Philosophy

The game world follows Ghost of Tsushima's design philosophy:
- **Wind as Guide**: Wind particles subtly guide players toward points of interest
- **Minimalist UI**: Clean interface that doesn't obstruct the world
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Shrines, springs, and ruins tell stories without text
- **Organic Exploration**: No rigid mission structure - players create their own journey
- **Atmospheric Immersion**: Audio and visual elements work together for mood

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### **System Overview**
- **Game.js**: Main game loop and system orchestration
- **Player.js**: Character controller, combat, and progression
- **WorldGenerator.js**: Procedural terrain and content generation
- **CombatSystem.js**: Enemy AI, combat mechanics, and spawning
- **UISystem.js**: Interface management and player feedback
- **AudioSystem.js**: Procedural audio generation and spatial sound

### **Rendering Pipeline**
1. **Scene Setup**: Three.js scene with enhanced lighting
2. **Toon Shading**: Custom vertex/fragment shaders
3. **Post-Processing**: Atmospheric effects and tone mapping
4. **Shadow Mapping**: PCF shadows with large shadow maps
5. **Fog Rendering**: Exponential fog for atmospheric depth

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Chunk-based Loading**: Only active world chunks are in memory
- **Geometry Instancing**: Shared geometries for similar objects
- **Material Pooling**: Reused materials for consistency and performance
- **Frustum Culling**: Automatic culling of off-screen objects
- **LOD System**: Distance-based level of detail (future enhancement)

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**
- **Archery System**: Bow and arrow combat mechanics
- **Mount System**: Horse riding for faster travel
- **Weather Effects**: Rain, fog, and seasonal changes
- **Story Missions**: Structured narrative content
- **Multiplayer**: Co-op exploration and combat
- **Save System**: Persistent character progression

### **Technical Improvements**
- **LOD System**: Performance optimization for distant objects
- **Texture Streaming**: Dynamic texture loading for large worlds
- **Audio Streaming**: More complex procedural audio
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls and optimization
- **VR Support**: Virtual reality compatibility
